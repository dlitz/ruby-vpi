h1. Notes

* When within Rake, rubygems is automatically available for use. no need to require() it again


h1. Pending tasks

* add support for reading & writing vpi_delay values

* define handled methods in Vpi::method_missing for faster response
** this has been verified as bottleneck from profiling data

* GHDL simulator supports VPI
** need way to invoke VPI tasks from VHDL, like @$ruby_init();@

* smarter test generation, which adjusts to user modifications in previously generated output


h1. Finished tasks

* add support for ESL prototyping (like SystemC)

* decouple code generation with $RUBYLIB and erb

* change should_be to should_equal in examples

* add support for GPL Cver in the test runner template

* build ruby-vpi once to generate all .so files
** test runner should not rebuild ruby-vpi every time

* distribute as a GEM, binary, and source
** use RUBYLIB to bypass rubygems site installation for local testing. otherwise have to build & install gem _every_ time!
** move stuff from lib/ into lib/ruby-vpi/

* integrate RCov for code-coverage statistics


h1. Obsolete tasks

* file bug report for Icarus 0.8 (l0_dcache)
** try new icarus snapshot
