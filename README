h1{text-align: center}. Welcome to Ruby-VPI

Ruby-VPI is a "Ruby interface":http://ruby-lang.org to "Verilog VPI":http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/standardstoc.jsp?isnumber=33945. It lets you create complex Verilog test benches easily and wholly in Ruby.

h2. Features

* Prototype and verify designs _quickly_ using "BDD(behavior-driven development)":http://behaviour-driven.org/, "TDD(test-driven development)":http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html, and more.
* Reuse the _same_ specification to verify both prototype and design.
* Specifications are executable _and_ human-readable. (See this <a href="./doc/usage.tutorial.html#fig..counter_rspecTest_spec.rb">example specification</a> and its <a href="./doc/usage.tutorial.html#fig..test-proto.rspec">boss-friendly output</a>.)

* Utilize Ruby's power and elegance. ("Why choose Ruby?":http://www.ruby-doc.org/whyruby)
** Built-in support for unlimited length integers, regular expressions, networking, multi-threading, system calls, _ad infinium_!
** Easy to use; doesn't get in your way.
** Makes programming _fun_ again!
