The *.doc files in this directory are plain-text files!

To transform them into XHTML, you need the following software:

* Rake:     http://docs.rubyrake.org/
* RedCloth: http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/
* Coderay:  http://coderay.rubychan.de/

Once you have the above software, simply run the "rake" command.
