h1. Release history

This is a record of important changes that have occurred with each release.


h2. Version numbering system

Ruby-VPI uses the "RubyGems rational versioning policy":http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/7 to number its releases. This "major.minor.build" numbering policy "is summarized":http://ablog.apress.com/?p=738 as follows.

* When the *major* number increases, functionally _incompatible changes_ have occurred. Thus, what may have worked in the previous version may not work in the new one.

* When the *minor* number increases, functionally _compatible changes_ have occurred. Thus, what worked in the previous version will work in the new one.

* When the *build* number increases, the _underlying implementation_ has changed. The functionality has not changed and no features have been added. Thus, what worked in the previous version will work in the new one.
